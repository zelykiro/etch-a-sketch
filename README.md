## How It Works

The cells change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

The color gets progressively darker. You must pass the same cell 10 times to get the darkest version of the color.

You can change the color by making use of the buttons below the grid.

    -   Random : generates a random color everytime you pass a cell.

    -   Black, Grey, Eraser and Reset are pretty self explanatory.

You can change the size of the grid by using the input box at the very bottom.
